                        <ul>
                            <li>Temenos Triton is a group that is out to explore Minoan magic, male intimacy, and men who love men. Anyone over the age of 21 is allowed as the group is very inviting and doesn't have to be gay or bisexual (Minoan Brotherhood, 2023).</li>
                            <li>The Temenos Triton was created due to the inspiration of the Tritons that had resided in the court of Neptuneâ€™s Fountain which sits along the front of the Library of Congress (Minoan Brotherhood, 2023).</li>
                            <li>The leader of the Temenos Trition is Leonidas who had started his own grove. Leonidas' focus is to empower the men who love men (Minoan Brotherhood, 2023).</li>
                            <li>Temenos Triton is located in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, right along the borders of Washington D.C. and National Harbor, MD (Minoan Brotherhood, 2023).</li>
                            <li>Temonos Triton originated from the Minoan brotherhood which consists of small groups called groves and each of the groves is typically less than 13 members (McShee, 2018).</li>
